            <p>This project idea formed because I constantly change my phone wallpaper. I generally use VSCO for mobile wallpapers.</p>
            <p>However, I'm super indecisive in which to pick and end up downloading multiple photos. I'm super lazy and hated opening the images in a new tab and saving each image one by one.</p> 
            <p>So, I decided to automate the entire process and have me not think about it. The script runs in the terminal and accepts usernames until you tell it to stop. You can check it out <a href="https://github.com/justTran/vscograb">here!</a></p>
